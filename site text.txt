This mod changes breeder effect of EstrusChaurus.esp by adding HasSpell check it so that you can only get pregnant by either a spider or a chaurus at a time.
[color=#00ff00]You must put this mod after Estrus Chaurus in your load order or pregnancy wont work[/color]

Estrus Chaurus but with Spiders, because everyone loves spiders!
This mod is an addon, so it is compatible with EC+ v4.31 and, maybe, future versions.
 
[font=tahoma]There are four methods by which the ES effect can be applied to the player or a follower:[/font]
[LIST]
[*]Spider spit attacks can trigger tentacle attacks - the chance of attack is configurable via the ES MCM(disabled by default as its unimmersive)[/*]
[*]Sexlab scenes involving a Spider triggered by another mod (e.g. Defeat, Submit & many others)[/*]
[*]Sexlab scenes involving a Spider Penis from [url=http://www.loverslab.com/topic/68035-sexlab-parasites-kynes-blessing-2016-12-15/]SexLab Parasites - Kyne's Blessing[/url][/*]
[*]ES+ scenes triggered by other mods, if there any that do this[/*]
[/LIST]
[color=#ff0000]Updating from version 3.xx to version 4.21r1 requires a clean save or new game.[/color]
[color=#ff0000]Updating from version less than 4.21r1 to version 4.xx requires a clean save or new game.[/color]

[spoiler]
 
ES+ uses pretty much same interfacing as Estrus Chaurus, but EC replaced with ES

[b][font=tahoma][color=#ffa500]Known Issues[/color][/font][/b]
 
[font=tahoma]Mod is not compatible with Arachnophobia, since both mods edit spider poison spit spell, you'll need to place ES after Arachnophobia or remove spider poison spit edit from Arachnophobia plugin or disable ES spit attack and place Arachnophobia higher in load order[/font]
[font=tahoma]There seems a problem with sexlab spider animations in recent SL[/font]
